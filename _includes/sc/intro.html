  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools
  around version control using Git.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and should end up walking away understanding the benefits of
  version control systems, and posessing competency with 
  using Git and Github for version control.

  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.

  This workshop is a test run in preparation for my certification
  with <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>
  for participation in Columbia University's
  <a href="https://rcfoundations.research.columbia.edu/">Research Computing Foundations</a> program
  through CUIT and CU Libraries. It is NOT an official The Carpentries workshop.
